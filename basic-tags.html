        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p> Here is a quote from another website:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/">
            Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
        </blockquote>
        <pre>
            In the pre element, the text is     displayed in a fixed-width    font, and it preserves both 
            spaces   and 
            line breaks.

                        In my mind, these critiques miss something important. Data science, despite its hype-laden veneer, is perhaps the best label we have for the cross-disciplinary set of skills that are becoming increasingly important in many applications across industry and academia. This cross-disciplinary piece is key: in my mind, the best extisting definition of data science is illustrated by Drew Conway's Data Science Venn Diagram, first published on his blog in September 2010.
